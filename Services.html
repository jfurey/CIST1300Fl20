    <h1>Services</h1>

    <p>Each experience begins with a thorough consultation, followed by a tailored experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our salon is departmentalized, meaning we have color specialists and style specialists.
        <br>
        When booking online, if you wish to receive both color and cut, please book accordingly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note: Hair consultations are always part of our color services and are available complimentary prior to all first-time services.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our color services do not include a blow dry. We have fully-stocked styling stations for you to use to blow dry your own hair.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you would like a full professional blow dry following your color service, please request this at the time of booking.
        <br>
        An additional charge will be added for this service. <span class="reditalics">*This is not available currently due to COVID-19*</span>
